2. **Challenge**: Nested button accessibility issue
   - **Attempted Solutions**: 
     - Changed close button to span with role="button"
     - Added proper keyboard event handlers
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved
   - **Resolution**: Used semantic HTML with proper ARIA

## 💡 **Learnings & Insights**

### **Technical Learnings**
1. **Learned**: Svelte 5 Runes system
   - **Context**: New reactivity model in Svelte 5
   - **Applied to**: All new components
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - `$state()` for reactive state
     - `$props()` for component props
     - `$derived()` for computed values
     - `$effect()` for side effects
     - `Snippet` type for children content

2. **Learned**: Advanced accessibility patterns
   - **Context**: Making components usable for everyone
   - **Applied to**: All components
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - ARIA attributes (aria-label, aria-live, aria-atomic)
     - Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
     - Focus management (trap focus, restore focus)
     - Reduced motion support

3. **Discovery**: CSS `will-change` and `contain` for performance
   - **Impact**: Better animation performance
   - **Applied to**: All animated components

### **Code Snippets**

```typescript
// Svelte 5 Snippet Pattern
interface Props {
  children?: import('svelte').Snippet;
}

let { children }: Props = $props();

// In template
{#if children}
  {@render children()}
{/if}
```

**What it does**: Replaces deprecated `<slot>` with new Svelte 5 syntax  
**Use case**: All components that accept children content

```typescript
// Toast Store Pattern
function createToastStore() {
  const { subscribe, update } = writable<Toast[]>([]);
  
  return {
    subscribe,
    show: (type, message, duration) => {
      const id = generateId();
      update(toasts => [...toasts, { id, type, message, duration }]);
      
      if (duration > 0) {
        setTimeout(() => dismiss(id), duration);
      }
      
      return id;
    },
    dismiss: (id) => {
      update(toasts => toasts.filter(t => t.id !== id));
    }
  };
}
```

**What it does**: Global notification system with auto-dismiss  
**Use case**: User feedback for actions (save, delete, error, etc.)

## 📝 **Additional Notes**

This was a great day for creating foundational components that will be used across the entire application. The focus on accessibility and user experience will pay dividends in the long run.

Key insight: Taking time to do things right (accessibility, documentation, testing) upfront saves time later and creates better products.

---

## ✏️ **Journal Entry**

Today reminded me why I love frontend development. Creating components that are not just functional but also accessible, beautiful, and well-documented is incredibly satisfying.

The process of iterating on the designs, fixing accessibility issues, and refining the animations was meditative. Each small improvement added up to something I'm really proud of.

Looking forward to Week 2 where we'll extend the design system and make everything even more consistent and polished.

---

**End of Day Status**: 🎉 Great day!

**Tomorrow's First Task**: Setup progress folder and documentation, then start on design system tokens.
